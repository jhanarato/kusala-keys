# Visual Meditation Timer

## User Story: Plug in the timer

The USB cable is plugged into a power block or a computer. The device powers up and fades in three keys of different colours. The keys, when pressed, choose from the following unit intervals:

- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes
- 15 minutes

## User Story: Select units of time

The meditator presses buttons 1-16. The multiple of the button number and the units is how long the timer is set for.

The keys 1 to the button pressed are lit up temporarily. After a delay a single key is left dimly lit.

## User Story: Toggle countdown indicator

Holding down the key in the story above results in the keys staying lit. As a unit of time passes a key becomes unlit.

## User Story: Start the timer

At this point the timer is running and will be displaying the countdown if chosen or a single dim key.

## User Story: Indicate time's up

When the time set is complete a pattern is shown to let the meditator know that the session has ended.

## User Story: Restart the timer

The user presses any key and we return to the state we began with when we plugged in the device.
