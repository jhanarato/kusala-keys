A repository for my Keybow 2040 hacks

I received a Keybow 2040 for Christmas and have a few projects in mind. I can probably combine them. 

- A visual meditation timer
- Display days until next uposatha
- Indicate fire danger level and total fire bans using the DFES RSS feeds.
- Indicate the next rubbish & recycling pickup days. 

Some of this can go into a library and main script on the keybow but for internet access
I'll attach the keyboard to a Raspberry Pi. Pi scripts can live in this repository as well.

The device github repository is here: https://github.com/pimoroni/pmk-circuitpython
